KTWIN is a Digital Twin platform built on top of Kubernetes and powered by Knative Serverless workloads. KTWIN uses Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to extend Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL), providing more control and flexibility over the underlying container-based services that compose the the DT landscape and reduction of operational costs by automating manual operations.
